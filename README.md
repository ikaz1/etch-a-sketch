# Etch A Sketch

:art: **[Live Demo](https://ikaz1.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)**

A virtual Etch-a-Sketch built for the web with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Emulates a real-life Etch-a-Sketch toy with some added features:

-   Range-slider - change the grid size of the sketch display
-   Color-picker - pick any color from the browser's built-in color-picker
-   Rainbow mode - each new pixel generates a random rgb color value
-   Erase or clear the display entirely

Made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
